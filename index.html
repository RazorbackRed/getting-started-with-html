  <b>Session 0 Notes</b>

<p><b>Major Parts of the Web</b></p>
<p>The web mis made up of a number of different pieces. I am part of the web, so is my computers. Computer browsers are connnected to servers using <em>HTTP</em>.  The final part of the web are the servers, which are very much like the hardware we use at home, but are optimized for hosting files.</p>
<p><b>HTML</b>- <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> is a type of document on the web.
<b>HTML</b> is made up of these elements;</p>
<p>1. <em>Text of content</em> - This is what you <b>see</b>.</p>
<p><em>2. Markup</em> - This is what it <b>looks</b> like.</p>
<p>3. <em>References to other documents -</em> This is usually made up of <b>images</b> and <b>video</b>.</p>
<p>4. <em>Links to other pages - </em>These take you to other pages on the <b>web</b>.</p>

<b>HTML Markup</b>
<p>HTML markup langage is made up of an opening tag, content and usually a closing tag. The closing tag includes a "/" to indicate the close of the tag. This entire sentence is called an <b>element</b>. Another important part of markup are <b>tags</b>. Tags provide direction regarding how the text should look (e.g., bold, italics, underlined).</p>

<p><b>Stupid Computers</b></p>
<p>Computers do not think on their own, they require a set of instructions for how to act. It is important to ensure that the instructions are precise and correct because the computer will follow whatever it is told to do, regardless of how incorrect those instructions are. Care with how we program is essential to avoid these mistakes.</p>
<p><b>Inline and Block</b></p>
<p>Examples of<em> Inline</em> elements are line breaks, bold, italics. <em>Block</em> elements have an invisible box around them that has height and width.</p>
